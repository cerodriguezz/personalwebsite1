My project is my personal website, it is composed of a few main sections!<br>
It consists of the home page, about page, and portfolio page, and a contact page in each of these sections you'll learn more about myself along with some pictures.<br>

I started by creating a git repository for my website. For the actual making of the website I started with a blank vs code file, I then started creating my home html, about html, portfolio html, and contact html files. After writing my code I started editing with css and I used a little js too. <br>

These are the pages and links that helped me out!!<br>
